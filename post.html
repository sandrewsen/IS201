                        <p>Choosing follow the path of Finance was not an easy decision. As you can see from my resume it was largely populated by jobs within the healthcare field. It was only when I transferred to BYU that I even began to consider following a path that did not involve healthcare.</p>
                        <p>It all began when my Mom, who at the time was an employee at the Alumni building directing events, told me of an event that the Finance program had put on. She recommended that may I should look into the business school on BYU compass. Well, she had piqued my interest. So I signed up for the first pre-req I needed. Accounting.</p>
                        <p>Accounting was hard and I wasn't sure I really enjoyed it, but then I took Finance and found that I enjoyed it much more. I loved that you can look to the future and help shape companies future decisions. I then did an internship at Clyde Companies and enjoyed being able to be involved in the financial side. This ultimately led me to applying for the finance program.</p>
                        <p>It ended up being a very competitive year to be accepted to the program and I thought for sure I was out of the running because of my inexperience in Finance. Though, despite all odds I was accepted to the program.</p>
                        <p>Finance was very hard for me because I was not used to the subject. Up until I was accepted I had never even opened the stock market or held a credit card.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>
                        <p>Even though Finance was taxing and difficult for me I learned that I was capable of way mroe than I thought I was. It is through tough experiences that we can grow and learn.</p>
                        <p>My progress though slow, was incredible because of the improvememt I saw. There were classes where I didn't get the grade I wanted, but I could look back and see how much I had actually learned and changed.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"Once can choose to go back toward safety or forward toward growth. Growth must be chosen again and again; fear must be overcome again and again." - Abraham Maslow</blockquote>
                        <p>Growth must never stop. I realized that fame, good grades and money don't define us. It is ultimately how much we grow, improve and serve.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>
                        <p>I still ultimately plan to reach for the stars and continue my path to healthcare, but with the knowledge I now have in Finance I have grown the industries that I can understand and participate in.</p>
